# PowerStat's FBApiGenerator for FritzBox APIs

This FBApiGenerator reads the api description from a FritzBox and generates an java api for it.

See:

## Installation

Because this library is only useful for developers, the installation depends on your build environment.

The first step would be to let the generator build the code from your FritzBox:

    mvn clean install -Dfb.hostname=<fritz.box> -Dfb.port=49443 -Dfb.username=<admin> -Dfb.password=<TopSecret!>

After this you could use the following dependency within your projects:

    <dependency>
      <groupId>de.powerstat.fb</groupId>
      <artifactId>api</artifactId>
      <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
    </dependency>

Please add the following entry to your maven `settings.xml`:

    <server>
      <id>nvd</id>
      <password>nvd api-key</password>
    </server>

The API-Key could be requested here: [National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/request-an-api-key)

Other build tools like gradle will work analogous.

Java platform module system:

    module com.example.java.app
     {
      requires de.powerstat.fb;
     }

To compile this project yourself you could use:

    mvn clean install org.pitest:pitest-maven:mutationCoverage site -Dfb.hostname=<fritz.box> -Dfb.port=49443 -Dfb.username=<admin> -Dfb.password=<TopSecret!>

or for native image creation:

On windows Visual Studio 2022 is required and you have to call:

    "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat" > nul

Compile and build image:

    mvn clean -Pnative package -Dfb.hostname=<fritz.box> -Dfb.port=49443 -Dfb.username=<admin> -Dfb.password=<TopSecret!>
    
Run the image:

    ./target/[imagename]

To find newer dependencies:

    mvn versions:display-dependency-updates
    
To find newer plugins:

    mvn versions:display-plugin-updates
    
To make a new release:

    mvn --batch-mode release:clean release:prepare release:perform -Dfb.hostname=<fritz.box> -Dfb.port=49443 -Dfb.username=<admin> -Dfb.password=<TopSecret!>
    git push -â€“tags
    git push origin master
    
To run checkstyle:

    mvn checkstyle:check
    
To run pmd:

    mvn pmd:check
    
To run spotbugs:

    mvn spotbugs:check
    
To run arch-unit:

    mvn arch-unit:arch-test
    
To run JDeprScan:

    mvn jdeprscan:jdeprscan jdeprscan:test-jdeprscan
    
To run toolchain:

    mvn toolchains:toolchain
    
If you use a sonar server:

    mvn sonar:sonar -Dsonar.token=<token>

If you use [infer][https://fbinfer.com/]:

    infer run -- mvn clean compile

To create a spdx:

    mvn spdx:createSPDX

To create a cycloneDX:

    mvn cyclonedx:makeBom
    
To upload bom to dependency-track:

    mvn dependency-track:upload-bom
    
To look for dependency-track findings: 

    mvn dependency-track:findings
